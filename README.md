# HypeHeatMap

#### _This will generate a list of bands that are gigging in your area, who are being written about online, 2019-02-01_

#### By _**Charley McGowan**_

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3.

## Project Scope

This project is hoping to build an app that will create a playlist for bands that are in your area playing soon.

It will also create a heat map for bands that have been blogged about, and where the blog is (mostly) located.

### Current Features

Currently it connects to a database in Firebase for updates, and users can input show locations with bands.

### Upcoming Features

Upcoming features will link it to something like HypeMachine (www.hypem.com) to get blogs about bands and then cross reference them against shows in your area to see if you can find bands that are playing soon, with blogs or publications written about them.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
